            This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you" or “your”) and this Website operator ("Operator", "we", "us" or "our"). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms "User", "you" or "your" shall refer to
            such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this
            agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Website and
            Services. By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not

        <div class="titleoftopic">Privacy of children</div>
        <div class="paragraphoftitle">
            We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to
            help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information
            through the Website and Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and
            legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their
            permission. Children of any age can use this website because we prohibit adult content.
        </div>

        <div class="titleoftopic">Use and processing of collected information</div>
        <div class="paragraphoftitle">
            We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the
            data controller and we would be the data processor
            <br><br>
            Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Website and Services. In
            such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of
            the processing of Personal Information.
            <br><br>
            We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Website and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.
            <br><br>
            In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we
            may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following
            purposes:
            <br><br>
            • Send product and service updates<br>
            • Respond to inquiries and offer support<br>
            • Improve user experience <br>
            • Protect from abuse and malicious users<br>
            • Respond to legal requests and prevent harm <br>
            • Run and operate the Website and Services
            <br><br>
            Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and
            Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have
            given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is
            necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. We may also combine or aggregate some of your Personal Information in order to better serve you and to improve
            and update our Website and Services.
            <br><br>
            Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object
            to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

        <div class="titleoftopic">Do Not Track signals</div>
        <div class="paragraphoftitle">
            Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this policy, we limit our use and collection of your Personal Information.
